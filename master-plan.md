## Presentations

### Content
Anything cool you've done, especially if it's in this summer! 

### Format
Presentations are done in a shortened [Pecha Kucha](https://pechakucha.com) format - 15 slides, 20 seconds per slide, for a total of 5 minutes. 

### Tone
We're looking for a casual, honest and genuine presentation. Take off the kiddie gloves and give us the cold hard truth, unabashedly unfiltered.

### Arcade Mode
Ah, you're a brave one aren't you? In Arcade Mode, you'll give the presentation, but we'll be providing the slides. You'll get to see your topic and deck at the start of the event, so think fast!

It'll be topics about SUTD, just so it's a little fairer for everyone.

Alex met with Carine, Jasmine and Bryan from D'Star on 30.8.2019.

Carine agreed to let us use the place, and Jasmine will be exploring what combo deals can be offered given the communal nature of the event.

They have requested that the event be extended to 7-10pm to maximise revenue. _We have not confirmed this, but will attempt to roster enough speakers for this._

They will share their offerings with us for input on the deals.

Dear XX,

I'm Alexander, a EPD Junior, and I'm planning SUTD Unfiltered, a small sharing session where we invite speakers to share their unfiltered experiences, in partnership with OpenSUTD. 

I'd like to invite you to join us as a speaker on 17th September (Tuesday) because I think you're an interesting person with equally interesting stories to share. This session's theme is Summer Unfiltered, so we'd be most excited if you share something about your summer experience - be it internship stories or exchange escapades.  The presentations will be done in the 20 x 20 PechaKucha format (see here: DANK PECHA KUCHA FORMAT) so as to keep things short and entertaining.

Do get back to me if you're keen or curious! 

Thank you for your time.

Regards,
Alexander
